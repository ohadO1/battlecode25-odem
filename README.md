# 🏆 MIT Battlecode 2025

Team: [Ohad](https://github.com/ohadO1), [Itai](https://github.com/itaisinger) and [Oren](https://github.com/OrenVaknin) \
This is the code we wrote for [MIT Battlecode 2025](https://battlecode.org/) — a project that took over our lives for a while. We barely slept, spent way too much time debugging, and somehow ended up with a bot we’re really proud of.

We pushed our strategy, optimization, and coding skills to the limit, and it paid off. We can’t wait to come back next year and take it even further.
